# StreetLightController_ArduinoUNO_DLDProject
Used an arduino uno with motion sensors to develop a smart street light controller system


A PIR sensor detects motion by detecting infrared radiation emitted by or reflected from objects. It is used to sense the motion of people, animals or other objects. Whenever an object passes the proximity of the PIR motion sensor (5 to 12 meters), the motion sensor will detect the infrared radiation emitted by the object. As soon as a car or any object for that matter passes under a streetlight, the motion sensor attached somewhat near the streetlight will give the signal to the Arduino connected and turn the streetlight on. Where, the LED will turn on for a period of 5 seconds (done through coding) and the LCD will display “Motion Detected” if an object is detected, otherwise the LED will be off, and the LCD will display “Motion Ended”.
